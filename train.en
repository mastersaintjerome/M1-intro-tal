NNAAMMEE hello
hello
yes NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello sir
I'm calling because I'm at a bus stop and there has been no buses for ten minutes er it's the 137 line
137 line yes
and it's the bus which goes to Paris actually it leaves from the industrial area er of Villeneuve-la-Garenne heading to Saint-Ouen Porte de Saint-Ouen
ok
I'm wondering cause I haven't seen any in the other direction either so I'm a bit worried
er it's a just slight delay or not
ok I'm going to see if I can
If I can find out when the next bus should come hold on please
thanks
thanks
yes madam the next bus should come in 21 minutes
in 21 minutes and so that means
that there are some
two haven't come
er now I can find out why they haven't come
but
because
there was the 18 one and you're telling me that the 33 won't be coming either well er
yes
yes this
often happens
er I'm at the stop of
Parc des Chanter des Chanteraines and there aren't there aren't any
oh there I have selected the industrial area
cause you mentioned the industrial area
oh but no in fact
well it's not very far
yes yes it's the stop of the
beginning   of the line
ok
huh yeah yeah
and the next one for Porte de Clignancourt is in 21 minutes
pff
ok
well then thanks
you're welcome madam
bye
bye
hold on a minute
hello
hello sir
hello
I would like to have some information about the Roissy bus
yes
Tuesday morning my grandaughter must take a plane at 9H40
yes
er I would like to know if there was an early morning bus
5h45 is the first one from The Opera
5h45 the first one and after when does the next one leave
one leaves every 15 minutes after it's simple you have one at quarter past half past and quarter to
ah yes it's quarter past half past er
etc
yes It's every 15 minutes in fact
for once they made things simple
Easy to remember
It's true
how long does it take to get there
It depends on the traffic normally it takes an hour
one hour
that's it
and so I have to count on
so if there was
a bus at 9h40 8h40 she wants to be there or
9 o'clock
no 9h
40 er the plane takes off so we must be there at 8h30 I reckon
yeah that's it so she must leave at 7h30 at the latest
at 7h30 the latest yes I thought 7h or 7h15
even 7h15 would be better perhaps for sure
and what about the bus tickets
where
oh no
there 's a special fare for the airport I will give you it so it's 9€ 10
9€10 we pay er 9€10 in cash huh
cash or credit card
cash will suit me fine
so well thanks
you're welcome
have a nice day

yes so the price is 5 euros you stick your identity photo on this Pass and you recharge it after so one to three it costs 22 euros 70 valid from Monday morning to Sunday evening
hum ok and then it's valid er only on the metro or on the buses too
so you are allowed on zones one to three to take the bus and the underground
and Rer ok
hum
so as I can see that you are very helpful would you have any maps er of the RATP Transilien there
so I will have to ask when you get there for instance huh when you get to the Paris region
yeah
you should ask for a map
ah ok
huh no it's no big deal if you ask and it's free huh
because  you don't send them by the post
Unfortunately not we used to do it
yes
er customer service anyway I don't know all they want to do now is save money so they no longer send anything unfortunately
oh ok because you must save your pennies everywhere
I guess
so
Some whose names I won't mention spend
so when you get to Paris you will er be given in either the underground or the Rer a free map
hum ok
thanks
for your kindness
please not at all
Not at all have a good evening bye
bye

one out of four is not one every three hours huh I'm sorry but there are no trains no buses every hour er usually it would be one out of four is what you are telling me in an hour it's more like er one out of twenty five we are far from it I'm sorry

It is
Going to stop

I think something will be done but I can't guarantee it
I think so yeah I think so
well
good luck thanks yeah
Sorry huh really cause I we take public transport
As well and we know very well that
It can cause yeah
It's really a hassle and the B
If it's not the strike it's something else
and there 's always
Something going on
even though it was a line before
Which was er
Before
I must say yeah
yeah
yeah
and we were told I was chatting to a driver and he told me that it was going to get worse
yeah it's
Likely yeah
because  there are people
Anyway cause things are being bulit and so obviously there will be more and more people and it will be
even more of a hassle
yeah I know
that huh at first when I worked in the department the Rer B was
Was one of the best lines
If you
hum hum
Compare to the Rer A as well
well it's the RER
hum hum hum hum
a was really a disaster
and er
I have the feeling that now it's yeah
but now I have the feeling it's the contrary
It's more chock-a-block
but er
It's really unbearable really huh
no but unfortunately I have no I have no yeah
even er when er there isn't any strike huh
I want to say even when there 's no strike

and do you know how often they ran today to know how it went er was roughly between ten minutes and a quarter or rather a quarter between each train in the morning when we could get on it
no yeah
but I don't know how it turned out during the day
no we don't have that information because it's really er
there
yeah
we don't have the information regarding the times whatever cause it's true that it's it's
This morning indeed er three out of four was that the information you had

They still have the nerve huh cause those who put up the message saying three out of four er we all got caught this morning we were are all all mad

They have
really er
we have that that as well huh on the RATP site it's the information we have and it's all we have

NNAAMMEE hello
NNAAMMEE hello
yes
hello sir
hello
hello sir
hello
yes
yes can you hear me well now
er very well yes
oh very well so well er I'm calling from outside Paris cause I have a wee thing to ask you we are going to er we are arriving we are going we are a small group and we are going to arrive by train at the Bercy station at Paris Bercy
yes
and we are going to the Musée d'Orsay
hum
so er after having looked at the underground map we thought that er from Bercy er to go and take the Rer C at the François Mitterand library and take the Rer C
and then get off at the Pont d'Alma
Do you think it's a good idea or not
I think it's a very good idea
yes but er well well
exactly
so just
a small detail it's at the Bercy station you must go on foot to the Bercy underground
yes
ok
to
to take the line 14 heading to Olympiades and get off at the Library
yes well
we will get off
huh cause on foot it's not the best
not it makes
er
yes
cause it is still really far huh
yes yes ok very well so we agree so well we would like to know as well if we can travel with just one underground ticket or several cause the
er Rer C
An underground ticket
Just one underground ticket from Bercy underground
oh yes because at the Library we always use the same one
yes
to take the the
RER
yes
C which belongs to the SNCF that one
yes but it doesn't matter in Paris it's all the same
oh ok ok yeah we were wondering what it was going to be like yeah ok it's Paris so we need just one underground ticket from Paris Bercy and we go all the way to Pont d'Alma
that's it
well and then it's the closest place to the Quai d'Orsay of the Musée d'Orsay
Of the Musée d'Orsay
yes
yes
cause we were thinking about also getting off at Bir Hakeim from Bercy
you know if you take the line er I don't remember which one six maybe er from
from Bercy
no it will be further
and if we got off at Bir Hakeim and
on foot on foot on foot it's too far
no no it's too far it's too far it's the Pont the Pont d'Alma
on foot it's too far huh
there
It's the Pont
D'Alma
yeah ok very well and so alright so now the only little thing also which worries us was to know if we travel with the Rer what ticket would we need to buy whatever
a normal underground ticket
Just one yeah which allows us to go through the gates from Bercy we can also go through the gates at the Library
yes indeed
With the same one
ok
With the same one
very well
so well thanks a lot
don't mention it sir
thanks a lot
Not at all

NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello
I'm calling cause actually I lost my Navigo Pass
yes
so well actually I had lost it well it was stolen and in fact I had lost it and it was brought back
very well
that's it but in fact it expired on October 30th
yes
and so I would like to know how to recharge it cause I don't know if I have to go to a sales office or if I can do it in the underground cause I saw there were some machines as it a Imagine R so it's a direct debit each month but I have subscribed for a year and now it has come to an end so I must recharge it and I don't know how I don't know how to do it
so for an Imagine R
er
yeah
you must inform them that you are still a student do they know that
yes yes I'm still a student
They know it cause you have declared losing your card
no I haven't declared it infact
because
so your Imagine R
we don't know if you have lost it
er no no they don't know if I have lost it they must well it doesn't work anymore so I must subscribe again for a year whatever
Indeed so you should have received a letter from Imagine R asking you to recharge your Pass again
for the new year er no
Did you get their letter
er no I didn't get it I didn't get anything
and when you go to a ticket machine can you
because  in fact yeah
Recharge your Pass once more
well I don't know in fact I have just got it back I don't know yet but I want to know if I must go to a ticket machine
in the underground then
Go to a ticket machine
Normally you should have got a letter
ok
Telling you that you could recharge your Pass once more
er ok
yeah could you hold on thanks
yes yes
ok otherwise so it was for the information which should be written when you can recharge once more
It's er
yes
you should go to a ticket office to find out if it is mentioned whether you have a delivery on the way that is to say that your demand has been examined and taken into account and you can recharge your Pass again
ok so I'm in the sh() so I haven't asked to recharge my my card before er normally it won't be possible whatever I won't be able to recharge it straight away is that it
no it can be done
It is done automatically
yes automatically it is done very quickly
As soon as you go to a ticket office they will see that you have a delivery on the way
ok
that is to say
ok
your card is ready to be recharged
and from then on you can recharge it and leave with it
ok
ok and to recharge it you must have the card er
well what do I need in fact
oh yes oh yes yes
oh yeah I need my credit card too
ok ok
Not even a credit card
oh no no you need your Navigo card
so I need my Navigo card but I don't need the credit card which
no not all
the ticket has been taken from
ok it is going to be done automatically
no no not at all not at all
ok ok very well ok because in fact I called them once and they told me I had to go to a sales office
the one in Montparnasse
yes
and they would take my pass er
so maybe they refused you it cause maybe you told them it was lost
then
yeah I had told them it was lost but yeah ok so yeah
that's why they told you that
oh yes so if it was lost
Declared lost you must indeed make another one huh that's for sure
no no no but it hasn't been declared lost so it's ok
so it's another story
ok well thanks a lot
don't mention it madam
Miss see you
have a nice day bye
bye
bye
NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello sir
er I'm leaving er this afternoon from Sebastopol and I must go to er Stains at 98 Jean Jaures Street

er the 98 so I'm leaving from 89 sorry and I must go to 98 jean Jaures street

Jean Jaures in Stains at no 98 huh
that's right
It's
it sir yeah
ok could you please hold

yes
at what time should you be there cause it's a little bit complicated the
trip
yeah it's a bit complicated
I must be there at 5 pm well 4 pm er 4.45 pm whatever
well it's not that it is complicated but it's true that it is not
obvious
yeah so in this case we are going to
cause there was the Rer D
yeah yeah er there was
but well at the moment er
well er the D it's ok it's ok huh
It is working the D
er
yes yes of course and you should take er get off at Pierrefitte Stains
Yeah
and after er on foot it is quite a walk
hum hum
huh you should take er what you can do is er is after catch the 2 er the 255 which passes next to the station which goes along Jean Jaures street
yeah
so there is a two or three minute walk huh you should look at the map of the area er to catch the 255
ok
heading to Les Prevoyants to the last stop
hum ok does the 255 pass through the Saint Denis university underground
yes but it's going to very long er it will be a long trip for you huh
It will be long
er I hid it earlier but not going through Saint Denis er in that case you should take it er er you can are you at Reaumur
at
yes
Reaumur Sebastopol you take the line 4 heading to Porte de Clignancourt to Porte de Clignancourt
hum hum
and there you have the first stop for the 255
ok well
heading to Les Prevoyants to Les Prevoyants but it will take you an hour and a quarter huh
huh oh yeah no an hour er un hour and a quarter it's far too long
well yes that's the problem huh
oh yeah yeah yeah it's far too long so if you
but otherwise it's true that it passes at Porte de Paris on the line 13 and with the change er between line 4 and the line 13 er is it worth it and after catch er Porte de Paris er yeah why not get off at Porte de Paris and there you can catch the 255 I don't know if you will gain much time huh huh
so you are telling me that it will take me an hour and a quarter to get there
yes it will take you er with the line 4 and the 255 well it's the 255 huh it's the first stop huh so there are quite a few stops huh
yeah yeah er what I meant was er so the easiest well the most convenient whatever is to take the Rer or the underground at Saint Denis university
huh if you are in a real hurry
well I'm not in a hurry but I would like it to be as short as possible whatever
oh yeah yeah well in this case it's the Rer huh
the RER
oh yes
to
to Pierrefitte Stains and after er a little walk to catch the 255
yeah
and after you'll be at Les Prevoyants
Pierrefitte Stains ok
get off
It will take you er
Roughly 45 minutes
ah well 45 minutes like that I will gain half an hour
oh yes that's why
oh well great
Rer D to Pierrefitte Stains the 255 Les Prevoyants and I get off at Les Prevoyants
that's it
and it is in the Jean Jaures street
yes that's it the 255 you will catch it er in Jean Jaures street
ok
huh you have a bus the 150 which can take you there but there is about a five minute walk is it worth waiting for the 150 to catch it to have two stops to catch the 150
the 255
no no no
I'm going to walk if it is only five minutes it's ok huh
oh yes yes it's not far

Them in fact
but you would like to reach er
what service
well let me explain
Normally I have an Imagine R card
yes
and well I lost I lost it that day
hum ok
and in fact I would like to reach er the people who deal with the fines to tell them to cancel it because I already pay for a subscription
and the problem is that the number is on the fine
well I don't have it I have lost the fine so I don't have the number
ok but it can't be done by phone huh if you want to benefit from a clemency measure

this
no
you must go there because they must see that you have a Pass which
Belongs to you
but in fact I don't have it
I lost it and I'll be getting it only in 8 days time
oh well in that case you must absolutely go to a sales office straight away with your identity card to declare the loss of your Pass
and there you will be
I have already
Made another
pass
Sorry for interrupting you
but I have already called in fact all is ok for the Imagine R card I called them and told them that I had lost my Pass and they are going to send me it in 8 days time
but the problem is that as the man gave me and in fact he wanted to give me a fifty euro fine but I didn't have fifty euros on me he raised it to seventy two
and the problem is that it will probably be raised again
hum
oh but then
in that case you are going to write
I can write it
huh you will explain what the situation is
Regarding your

er place er well ok

ok thanks have a good afternoon
you are very kind thanks a lot
bye madam
NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello madam
er
hello
I am NNAAMMEE NNAAMMEE I work in a town hall in the Loire Atlantique region
yes
er hum we have a group of children in the townhall who are going er on the 14th of December to Paris to visit the National assembly
yes
so er they are going by train and they will have to take the underground after to go to the National Assembly
ok
and so I was on the RATP site and I wanted to know er if we could buy the tickets already and if there was also a special fare for groups
so
so what station are you going to arrive at
Montparnasse
Montparnasse so it's a group of pupils is that it
yeah there are ten er sorry twelve sixteen children and two adults
so there are sixteen children and two adults
yes
so they are only going to do one trip in the day and then go back
well I don't know exactly when they arrive in the morning and leave in the evening so they visit the National Assembly in the afternoon yes they may move around later
It's in Paris
indeed
yeah move around in Paris
so on the other hand on our site you should have seen that there were groups for youngsters
yes
huh but that is for ten pupils and an accompanying adult
hum hum
so you are sixteen and two
hum hum
so normally it's ten for one so we will have to see otherwise it allows you to have a reduced price
for everyone
yes
in fact er the children and the adults
that's right
ok
that's it so on the other hand as you are sixteen plus two I must check huh to see what happens so it allows you to have the reduced price ticket which means you are allowed to have the reduced price tickets
ok
Knowing that the reduced price tickets will cost you 5 euros 70
and you will have ten tickets
5 euros 80
so 5 euros 80 the reduced price tickets
and it will be for ten tickets
so er it isn't possible to order them in advance cause you need to buy tickets for a value of at least 150 euros
oh yes ok
ok so what other tickets are there how old are the children
er they are between the ages of 10 and 12
ok cause otherwise after there are day trip tickets er so they are coming during the week then
yes
It would be
5 euros 90 per child per person
hum ok
Otherwise it is called
the Mobilis and there you have a ticket which is valid all day long and so they can take the underground and after if they want to visit Paris it's 5 euros 90
ok
Now for the group of youngsters I'm going to look it up huh please hold on a minute
thanks
yes
please
yes
so indeed huh you are allowed to have the youngsters group ticket there 's no problem about that so you will all benefit from reduced prices if you go on our RATP site
yes
Did you see the youngsters group huh
but I saw that there was a reduced price for youngsters ok but there is a form
so
there to fill out
to print in two copies the two copies you have to fill out huh
ok
cause there is one copy that you keep and the other which you give to the agent at the station
ok
ok so well after you indicate how many tickets you need
and the trip
ok
ok so after you have to do some calculating huh either you do that if you have only one or two trips or if you are really going to visit Paris after what can be interesting is the 5 euros 90 ticket
yes
Like that you don't need to worry all day long
ok yes yes
ok
and so on the other hand you can't order them before so you will have to buy them once you're there whatever
actually
yes that's it
When we get to Montparnasse
ok
ok
ok
well thanks
have a very good day
bye
thanks bye

ah yeah
han
so uh
so when you arrive in Paris you're going to go to any RATP sales point you come to Gare de Lyon

uh we would like the tckets just for
there for uh for doing Gare de Lyon Bastille what

NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello
I'm calling you because in fact I would like to update the amounts of uh the Full card for my company in the in the payroll software
okay
and in fact there I I I have a small problem which is that for the previous months of the Full card it wasn't me who dealt with that uh there is the air of having the Full card uh zone uh hmm uh how to say uh
according to the zones it's not the same price
yeah according to the zones it's not the same price but I see from four to six four to seven and four to eight and when I go on your site
yes
I have no
there 's no six there 's no seven
is it normal if if to say that seven and eight have been uh removed they have been included in the six
so it stops at six zones before there were zones seven and eight
okay
we've removed
the seven and the eight and we have included both with the six
so people
if you have people who are in zones seven and eight you take as the price five and six
so uh towards I'm not looking it's that I always take the beginning of the zone that is good and then on the other hand all that is five six six uh everything that is uh
everything that is seven and eight
uh six
six six seven six eight seven eight all of that suddenly no longer exists
that that exists the more you you take the price that stops at six
okay and all that is a link between six and seven that does not exist any longer
no
it is from seven and eight no longer
it's that the six
right OK
eh well thank you very much
don't mention it
good bye

one moment
NNAAMMEE is taking your call
NNAAMMEE hello
hello madam
good morning
I'm calling you because I am very old and then I thought that I understood uh
we ha() my husband and I received
yes
the travel card huh
yes
a small card for uh taking the metro
yes
that's it but afterwards we reminded you that for renewing your pensioner's card you have to make a written request
yes
but why change it
because it has there is a date on the card
no
there is an expiry date
not on the card no
when did you do your card
goodness me do I know it's maybe uh uh twenty thirty years I don't know twenty twenty years
and at the top of the card it's written RATP pensioner's card
so you have a travel card as an RATP agent
that's it
retired
yes
that's right
have you
never changed your card since
never
but it's now twenty years that we've been in the countryside
and they are ah you are not in the Paris region
so okay
nah nah nah it's not used
I had even lost it I didn't find it
okay
but it's written
so now I understand it better
we remind you that the renewal of your pensioner's card will be done by a written request from you
absolutely
in case
of change of address or change of the situation
ah
in case
so then since I have not changed address and we have not divorced
so
because in fact
actually there are new uh
agent cards which are in circulation
because the old ones well I guess the one you have would not work any longer if you come to the Paris region and if you try to use it it will not work
yes but it's not with that that we pass
twenty years
it's with the small card
you have that card there
you didn't tell me
I have two
so I have the yellow one
there 's a card
for travelling on the metro and buses
yes bah it's it's certainly that
it's that it's the uh it's the
right it's that card there
the one that I received there because they have changed the small one
that's it
wait see that one there what's it called that one there uh we're delivering this travel card here
here so
it's the travel card
so it's
it's the travel card that will go up to four
eleven
that's it
two thousand t() two thousand and nineteen
do you realise
two thousand and nineteen
so you still have time
ah bah I know I have
I received it this week
bah that is why yes
they so they sent it to you directly
ah yes yes they sent it to me
right so it
but
on that date there there is actually a date on that card
right that's it it's with that
that's it
to the effect that
in the one in the thing
and so it's this card there if you
lose it you must apply
but hum but but s()
uh re () for renewal all alone
but but but uh uh do I still have to have this card as a retired agent after what I have understood
absolutely
hm well then s () that's good like that huh my small card will work there
right absolutely
but you know we are both eighty-one years old and so now it's no longer so easy to understand
to understand
not at all madam
please no harm done
I wa() I was afraid of being wrong
nah nah please no harm done huh
well thank you for being so kind
don't mention it have a good day
have a nice day as well
good bye madam
good bye
hmm NNAAMMEE hello
yes NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello this is the Bobée college at Yvetot in Seine-Maritime
yes
and we organise several trips during the course of the year uh to Paris for using the metro
yes
we would want two hundred tickets how should we p() proceed
two hundred tickets
yes
uh
maybe you can place an order directly
but yes that is what we would like to do
okay
two hundred tickets
yes
because that will depend on the amount of of the overall price
yes
yeah
well I just made a calculation huh you can
hold on please
yes yes yes
yes yes yes
no madam the amount is not large uh enough you'll have to go directly to the counter when you get there
ah yes okay so but it's uh it's not very easy for us because well when you arrive from the province well generally you get off the train it's always a bit of a hurry
yes
is there no other way of doing it
um not in relation to this amount not for this amount it won't be possible no
and what amount is needed
a minimum of one hundred and fifty euro
and here how much is it
it's one hundred and sixteen
ah well I can go up to one hundred and fifty euro huh
ah okay
you can place a
ah yes
bigger order uh
that's it
so I'm going
uh
to try to put you in touch directly with the service
for an uh order
so it's a
so there 's a discount for students
uh yes of course
okay
yes yes yes
yes yes good that's good yes yes no but hmm
I can I can give you two hundred because well uh it's the same I didn't have a figure it was just around what is used every year but except we go back a year afterwards and it's all huh
okay
so
yes
uh have you never
well yes just
placed an order ah yes
uh order no not order if you want I always had someone who was going to Paris that took
ah okay
so a sheet
that we made but now it's becoming a little more complicated so
uh
well the
sheet you can withdraw it directly
well yes but the
uh in relation to
travel
huh on internet
yes but now for
uh
ah
the request for group travel it's that sheet you're talking about
well I do not know if we got it on the internet but I had someone who brought it to me from Paris and he was told anyway until then it posed no problems but now we're told that we need to make a photocopy of the document of the teacher who accompanies them and attach the sheet uh used for such a trip so that when I organise a set of two hundred tickets well the trips are made as you go along if you want
okay I understand uh I'll try to put you in direct contact with the person

exactly
good well thanks
a lot good bye sir thanks
don't mention it madam have a nice day good bye
good bye
yes
NNAAMMEE hello
hallo yes good morning madam
good morning
uh
I wanted to know what to do for
uh
uh because there was a problem on Tuesday which was the day of the strikes
yes
uh I was arriving from Orly
yes
um and then I learned at Orly that the shuttle uh jet bus had been cancelled it no longer existed
yes
so I took the what's it called
uh the small shuttle uh
that what's it called this small shuttle that co() that connects uh Orly Sud and Orly Ouest
hmm hmm
and after uh
I had to take the
Rer B and I wanted to get off at Châtelet
yes
uh so well I got my ticket that is still nine euros eighty-five uh I have waited a good half hour I didn't know there were the strikes so I waited and uh instead of taking me to Châtelet it let me off it let me off at Denfert-Rochereau
yes
and at Denfert-Rochereau I saw many staff of RATP and I told them it's not normal that we are made to pay while we're not given the expected uh service
of course
and uh they told me uh well weill let you pass without paying and I said well yes but at Orly they'll make us pay so then so then I wanted to know if I could do some thing
so in fact you got your ticket for nine euro at Orly for Orly
yes nine nine eighty-five
and you wanted nine nine nine
eighty-five and you want a refund
that's right
well I'd like that yes
so right now I'm going to look at the refund procedure
because I have I have the supporting material huh
for the ticket
I have my ticket my receipt for the credit card with which I paid
yes of course
that's it
so I'm going to look so it's a ticket for Orlyval huh that you
had taken huh that's right huh
here it's Orlyval it's written on
that's it
okay I'm going to look at the the procedure hang on
yes thank you very much
one moment
thank you
madam please
yes
so if I have understood you stamped your ticket initially huh
uh well yes I was obliged to
to return uh to pass the gate
hm yeah of course
so here there is nothing checked nothing unfortunately once the ticket has been used there is no refund procedure they don't refund at all because as it's a tax that's a little bit special for the airport it's the customer
hmm
service at Orly that deals with this
hmm
and uh there uh uh uh they don't refund at all once the ticket has been stamped
so now I can still give you the
well yes but uh it's up to them yes
contact details for Customer Service to make a claim
yes
but uh for us there is no refund
uh
okay
well I'm going to do it all the same we know
never
of course so it's Orlyval Customer Service
ah it's the s() it's an Orlyval
okay
absolutely
yes
so Orlyval Service
hmm hmm
th() the address is Chemin de Frêne
so Chemin de Frêne
ninety-one three hundred and twenty
yes
Wissous W I S twice O U S
okay
so you have to send the ticket
yes
obviously
with a
yes
small letter of explanation
yes
saying
that following the strike
right but I am going to try as I explained
uh it's not
you can always try but it's true that for us apparently they have reported that there is no refund if it's stamped
hmm
but because it's a result of the strike you can always try it's not a problem huh
well yes yes but it's stamped it is necessary to stamp it
otherwise you don't get through if I had
of course of course
if I had known I would have taken uh the bus
that's called
hmm
Orly I don't what uh there 's a bus
yeah yeah yeah
the yes
what's more I didn't know that there ()
the Orlybus yes there are Air France buses it's full of yes there are plenty of things yeah
yes yes yes right
hmm hmm hmm
I made the wrong choice
good well listen thanks
a lot
don't mention it
have a nice
good bye
day
good bye madam
hallo
NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello uh
I'm calling you I I don't know if you're going you can but in any case I would like a phone number I I want to settle some transportation problems for for classes for group classes in the context of projects uh
when you tell me settle that is settle
so
you want
to pay or there was a problem
no no no no there 's uh not it's that I'm a big departmental association in Seine-Saint-Denis and we work with uh around a hundred classes and I want to arrange travel for these classes at certain times of the year using public transport
okay
that's it
so uh I foolishly thought
at the start that it was sufficient that had the prof and the headteacher fill in uh an exit form and that I give the class half-price tickets and I was told me that this is not the way works at all
no
not so hang on and sit I'm going to I'm going to give you all the information at the level of c() of classes uh
yeah
for travelling in Paris huh
please hold on
thank you
don't mention it sir
yes
so for that uh on the RATP dot fr site there 's the youth group form that you have to download
I have that
okay so you have to fill it in correctly
have it stamped by the head of the institute or group in any case
and then you must give it back to the station agent and only he can give you your discounted tickets
that's to say there 's no way I can
so
so that I buy a certain number of
so because in fact then a() it's it's not the p() ah yes one moment because I have not finished
sorry
I understood that you were talking to me about over a hundred students that's what
no more than one hundred classes
one hundred classes
yes okay because there are lots of tickets to buy so then
so
so there 's a lot of tickets to buy and it's not for the same day because they are activities that will take place throughout the school year
okay
and uh and and and uh like that I would have given you all the information and I am the operator on behalf of the class that I received from the General Council and so it's not the class that buys
okay
well what I'm going to do sir is I'll transfer you to the person that deals uh so uh you're never gone through this system of selling in numbers uh of tickets
no because I believe
that we started
because I think
it would be the best
we were
because then there will be
a quantity of tickets
bah yes then in addition I would especially like uh to not have to go to buy tickets uh uh fifteen tickets thirty tickets forty tickets every day
no no no well I'm going to transfer you to the service
that deals with this because furthermore it starts from ten ticket books from ten so that makes one hundred tickets or one hundred and fifty euro in purchases huh so you you are well
it will be greater
greater huh
uh and you told me that you were an association
yes absolutely an association uh at the departmental level in the department of ninety-three and working for the General Council
and for the inspectorate so that is why
and so it's for having youth groups tickets huh
eh yes
finally that's for it's for being able
for groups of uh classes
to have classes travel by benefiting
of a youth group hm
from a reduced fare
okay okay
well I'm going to try to transfer you to the person who deals with this okay
okay sir hold on
thank you very much
thank you
yes NNAAMMEE
yes hello NNAAMMEE it's NNAAMMEE of the
Remote Customer Service
yes
uh I'm calling to transfer a new customer
yes
so
it's an association that works for the General Council of Seine-Saint-Denis
yes
huh and so she would like to make a very very big order of tickets for uh for youth groups in the future
okay
I'm transferring to you
hmm
see you cheers
thank you
NNAAMMEE
good morning
good morning
yes hello NNAAMMEE NNAAMMEE
uh I was wondering if there have been incidents on line thirteen and line six uh today this morning
ah then I'll find out if there have been incidents sir huh so line thirteen and line six this morning
so
as
I was saying for line thirteen and line six
yes please
one moment I'm taking a look sir
sir if you don't mind
sir
don't mention it
hallo
yes so what I see for line thirteen t() this morning there was a hardware failure at seven thirty-nine
w() w() wait th() th() there 's a lot of interference on the line so it's very difficult to understand about line thirteen this morning
starting from seven thirty-nine you have had a hardware failure
a hardware failure
absolutely so right now even a litt bit earlier the traffic was even so a train was parked uh at Gabriel Gabriel Péri
then the service was restored and on line six at nine o'clock there was a sick traveller where again the train had to park at Edgar Quinet
and and and that lasted how long on line thirteen and line six
it was
so
uh so on line thirteen disrupted traffic started on the other hand at six thirty-three
at what time
six thirty-three
on line six or thirteen
yes at
not line thirteen huh at the level of a hardware problem because in the end there was traffic but it was very disrupted
and afterwards the tr() the train parked at seven twenty-seven on line thirteen so at Gabriel Péri
yeah
then uh it gradually gradually picked up again so in any case it remained not badly disrupted and then there was a sick traveller at seven minutes past nine at the station of Edgar Quinet
and there it picked up again
Edgar
Edgar Quinet
yes
and and and there it picked up again at what time
and after it picked up again at nine twenty-three
on line six
okay nine o'clock nine twenty-three and line thirteen I st() still haven't understood when it picked up again it had started at seven twenty-seven it picked up again at what time
for the line thirteen there were different incidents huh first towards six twenty-two where there there was a hardware failure where the train was parked
yeah
hm it was at the fork but after you also had a second where another train was parked and that was there fore at seven twenty-seven at Gabriel Péri
but it lasted how long
uh so there so there six fifty-eight uh
it gradually resumes I have no interruptions at stations but I then have uh s disruption on line thirteen
it's is this is this is this information that can be seen the site because I'm on the RATP website and I not see it
ah about if yes it's disrupted yes but the information of the hardware fault is at each station we can see it but not you
ah yes that's to say that I can see if there are strikes uh uh I can see that th() the B
is disturbed but that's all we have if you want to have by line you have to phone
ah well otherwise right now yes you'll have uh in time and when if you want
that's to say that in the morning it is
indicated after they take it off you see
ah right OK
so it's a service uh online
that's why you no longer see it
at that time there
okay
you see then there at that hour the traffic is res() is restored so you no longer have information of the morning failure
and you can't have the history
no
no I kn() all that it is because I I I I I consistently have absences uh
that's the reason
ah okay yeah
ah there there has been a problem on these two lines uh this morning huh
I can confirm this
okay
ok thank you madam
don't mention it
good bye

I'm calling you because I'm at a bus stop and the bus has not passed in the last ten minutes uh it's line one hundred and thirty-seven
one hundred and thirty-seven yes
and it's the bus going in the direction of Paris in fact which leaves from industrial zone uh of Villeneuve-la-Garenne and going to Saint-Ouen Porte de Saint-Ouen

okay I'm going to take a look if I can
if I can give you the next time please hold on
thank you
thank you
yes madam so the next bus is scheduled in twenty-one minutes
twenty--one and that means
that two
them have not passed
uh now I can find out why they have not passed
but
because
there was the one of eighteen and you're telling me that the thirty-three will not come uh
yes
yes this is
so frequent
uh I'm at the stop in
the park of Chanter des Chanteraines there 's there 's not what finally I
ah I took it at uh the industrial zone huh
you're talking about the industrial zone
ah yes no but
well it's not very far
yes yes this is the stop of it's the
start of the line
okay
huh yeah yeah
and the next one for uh Porte de Clignancourt it's the twenty-one minutes
whew
okay
good well thanks
not at all madam
good bye
good bye
will answer you
good morning
good morning sir
good morning
I would like to inquire about the Roissy bus
yes
on Tuesday morning I have my young daughter who must take a plane at nine forty
yes
uh I would like to know if the buses start early in the morning
the first leaves Opéra at five forty-five
five forty-five the first and afterwards it's how often
every fifteen minutes after it's easy huh it's quarter past the hour half past the hour quarter to the hour
ah yes it's quarter half past uh
and so on
yes it's really every fifteen minutes
for once they've done something simple and
easy to remember
that's true
and it takes how long to get there
it depends on the traffic but on average expect an hour
one hour
that's it
well we must
so if there was
at nine forty eight forty she wants to be there or
nine o'clock
no nine
forty th() the plane takes off so it must be half past eight I guess
yeah she needs so she needs to leave at the latest at half past seven huh
at half past seven at the latest yes I had imagined seven o'clock seven fifteen
quarter past seven that would be even better perhaps that's it absolutely
and and the bus tickets
or
ah no
specific airport service pricing I'll give you the price huh so the price is nine euro ten cents
nine euro ten cents you get uh nine euro ten cents cash huh
cash credit card
so but cash will be fine
eh well listen thank you
don't mention it
have a nice day
