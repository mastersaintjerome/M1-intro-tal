I 'm calling because I 'm at a bus stop and there has been no buses for ten minutes er it 's the hundred and thirty seven line
hundred and thirty seven line yes
and it 's the bus which goes to Paris actually it leaves from the industrial area er of Villeneuve-la -Garenne heading to Saint-Ouen Porte de Saint-Ouen
ok
I 'm wondering cause I have n't seen any in the other direction either so I 'm a bit worried
er it 's a just slight delay or not
ok I 'm going to see if I can
if I can find out when the next bus should come hold on please
thanks
thanks
yes madam the next bus should come in twenty one minutes
in twenty one minutes and so that means
that there are some
two have n't come
er now I can find out why they have n't come
but
because
there was the eighteen one and you 're telling me that the thirty three won 't be coming either well er
yes
yes this
often happens
er I 'm at the stop of
parc des Chanter des Chanteraines and there are n't there are n't any
oh there I have selected the industrial area
cause you mentioned the industrial area
oh but no infact
well it 's not very far
yes yes it 's the stop of the
beginning of the line
ok
huh yeah yeah
and the next one for Porte de Clignancourt is in twenty one minutes
pff
ok
well then thanks
you 're welcome madam
bye
bye
hold on a minute
hello
hello Sir
hello
I would like to have some information about the Roissy bus
yes
tuesday morning my grandaughter must take a plane at nine forty
yes
er I would like to know if there was an early morning bus
five forty five is the first one from The Opera
five forty five the first one and after when does the next one leave
one leaves every fifteen minutes after it 's simple you have one at quarter past half past and quarter to
ah yes it 's quarter past half past er
etc
yes it 's every fifteen minutes in fact
for once they made things simple
easy to remember
it 's true
how long does it take to get there
it depends on the traffic normally it takes an hour
one hour
that 's it
bon et il faut  and so I have to

so if there was
a bus at nine forty eight forty she wants to be there or
nine o'clock
no nine o'clock
forty er the plane takes off so we must be there at eight thirty I reckon
yeah that 's it so she must leave at seven thirty at the latest
at seven thirty the latest yes I thought seven o'clock or seven fifteen
even seven fifteen would be better perhaps for sure
and what about the bus tickets
where
oh no
there 's a special fare for the airport I will give you it so it 's nine euro ten
nine euro ten we pay er nine euro ten in cash huh
cash or credit card
cash will suit me fine

have a nice day
you too
NNAAMMEE will answer your call
NNAAMMEE hello
hello
yes hello
er I 'm calling you to know about the zones er Orange decouverte card er in Paris
yes
er hum er er I want to know which zone Champigny sur Marne is in that 's to say if I get an thirty seven euros twenty Orange card er for the week will I be able to go there or not
to Champigny sur Marne
I 'm going to tell you
so Champigny
and in any case coming from Paris is that right
yes yes
coming from Paris with an Orange card
er hum ok hum ok
hum there is no problem then er
so you are in zones one to three
which means one to three er weekly it means twenty seven euros ninety
yes
er
one to three sorry twenty two euros seventy sorry twenty two euros seventy
because I had a fare a fare from July two thousand and nine one to three they had written twenty two euros thirty it must have gone up
er yes it 's twenty two euros seventy now
it went up right
yes so on top of it the Pass
er Navigo Decouverte the value is five euros
er valid for one week and you must have with you an identity photo to make the card which costs five euros
that 's it
that 's it
so you do n't have to have an identity card huh er do you come to Paris sometimes
yeah
or er
from time to time
ok
so can ask in any station either RER or an underground a Pass Navigo Decouverte
yes so the price is five euros you stick your identity photo on this Pass and you recharge it after so one to three it costs twenty two euros seventy valid from Monday morning to Sunday evening
hum ok and then it 's valid er only on the metro or on the buses too
so you are allowed on zones one to three to take the bus and the underground
and RER ok
hum
so as I can see that you are very helpful would you have any maps er of the RATP Transilien there
so I will have to ask when you get there for instance huh when you get to the Paris region
yeah
you should ask for a map
ah ok
huh no it 's no big deal if you ask and it 's free huh
because you do n't send them by the post
unfortunately not we used to do it
yes
er customer service anyway I do n't know all they want to do now is save money so they no longer send anything unfortunately
oh ok because you must save your pennies everywhere
I guess
so
some whose names I won 't mention spend
so when you get to Paris you will er be given in either the underground or the RER a free map

NNAAMMEE hello
NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello sir
er I would like to know please the RER B
b huh for Bernard yes
well until when they will be on strike
so I honestly do n't know it is renewable renewable every day
er
yeah it 's what I've noticed
cause every day
we are told that it will stop
yeah I know
it is
going to stop
I know very well
and we are now told that from what I can see er on the site is that three out of four it 's wrong though
that 's not true
yes so
that 's normally during rush hour
er
but this morning
it was the rush hour er and I could n't get on a single RER
yeah
yeah
at the rush hour yeah
humm
er and so you do n't know if it will go on tomorrow
no we do n't have any information no no no I 'm sorry
and by the way are they planning on reimbursing us
users
I
do something about it
a wee commercial gesture ah yeah cause now we 've had enough
I think something will be done but I can 't guarantee it
I think so yeah I think so
well
good luck thanks yeah
sorry huh really cause I we take public transport
as well and we know very well that
it can cause yeah
it 's really a hassle and the B
if it 's not the strike it 's something else
and there 's always
something going on
even though it was a line before
which was er
before
I must say yeah
yeah
yeah
and we were told I was chatting to a driver and he told me that it was going to get worse
yeah it 's
likely yeah
because there are people
anyway cause things are being bulit and so obviously there will be more and more people and it will be
even more of a hassle
yeah I know
that huh at first when I worked in the department the RER B was
was one of the best lines
if you
hum hum
compare to the RER A as well
well it 's the RER
hum hum hum hum
a was really a disaster
and er
I have the feeling that now it 's yeah
but now I have the feeling it 's the contrary
it 's more chock-a-block
but er
it 's really unbearable really huh
no but unfortunately I have no I have no yeah
even er when er there is n't any strike huh
I want to say even when there 's no strike
yes yes when it
runs normally that 's all
exactly yeah
well er we are we are
packed like
sardines even though we pay er we
yeah yeah yeah yeah

and do you know how often they ran today to know how it went er was roughly between ten minutes and a quarter or rather a quarter between each train in the morning when we could get on it
no yeah
but I do n't know how it turned out during the day
no we do n't have that information because it 's really er
there
yeah
we do n't have the information regarding the times whatever cause it 's true that it 's it 's
this morning indeed er three out of four was that the information you had

always that I have
on er the internet site on the voicemail anyway
yeah that 's what we have and we do n't have anything else
we do n't have any other information unfortunately er regarding the RER now we do n't have any other information to give you huh
they still have the nerve huh cause those who put up the message saying three out of four er we all got caught this morning we were are all all mad

one moment
NNAAMMEE hello
NNAAMMEE hello
yes
hello sir
hello
hello Sir
hello
yes
yes can you hear me well now
er very well yes
oh very well so well er I 'm calling from outside Paris cause I have a wee thing to ask you we are going to er we are arriving we are going we are a small group and we are going to arrive by train at the Bercy station at Paris Bercy
yes
and we are going to the Musée d' Orsay
hum
so er after having looked at the underground map we thought that er from Bercy er to go and take the RER C at the François Mitterand library and take the RER C
and then get off at the Pont d' Alma
do you think it 's a good idea or not
I think it 's a very good idea
yes but er well well
exactly
so just
a small detail it 's at the Bercy station you must go on foot to the Bercy underground
yes
ok
to
to take the line fourteen heading to Olympiades and get off at the Library
yes well
we will get off
huh cause on foot it 's not the best
er
yes
cause it is still really far huh
yes yes ok very well so we agree so well we would like to know as well if we can travel with just one underground ticket or several cause the
er RER C
an underground ticket
just one underground ticket from Bercy underground
oh yes because at the Library we always use the same one
yes
to take the the
rER
yes
c which belongs to the SNCF that one
yes but it does n't matter in Paris it 's all the same
oh ok ok yeah we were wondering what it was going to be like yeah ok it 's Paris so we need just one underground ticket from Paris Bercy and we go all the way to Pont d' Alma
that 's it
well and then it 's the closest place to the Quai d' Orsay of the Musée d' Orsay
of the Musée d' Orsay
yes
yes
cause we were thinking about also getting off at Bir Hakeim from Bercy
you know if you take the line er I do n't remember which one six maybe er from
from Bercy
no it will be further
and if we got off at Bir Hakeim and
on foot on foot on foot it 's too far
no no it 's too far it 's too far it 's the Pont the Pont d' Alma
on foot it 's too far huh
there
it 's the Pont
d' Alma
yeah ok very well and so alright so now the only little thing also which worries us was to know if we travel with the RER what ticket would we need to buy whatever
a normal underground ticket
just one yeah which allows us to go through the gates from Bercy we can also go through the gates at the Library
yes indeed
with the same one
ok
with the same one
very well
so well thanks a lot
do n't mention it Sir
thanks a lot
not at all
have a nice day bye

so I've asked several drivers
yes
who told me that you do n't give them out anymore
yes indeed you want you are talking about the timetable sheets huh is that it
yes that 's it
yes indeed because now in fact you can print them out on internet

I think in your
so
terminus
er
the er
I called your service er and I was told to find out at my townhall

all of a sudden
yes but there
are n't any
there are n't any

asks the garage and well usually they have
a big packet

the townhall
the Townhall
should order and er then after er we could get the timetables at the Townhall indeed if they do n't ask for them of course there won 't be any

yes
which arrived at the Gare du Nord at twenty one sixteen
yes
a hanging bag er black with a suit inside
so it was on the RER B last night
at twenty one sixteen
ok a black hanging bag
with a men 's grey suit inside
so a black hanging bag with a men 's grey suit huh
hmm hmm
ok very well it was last night I 'm going to check
ok
please hold on
yes of course thanks
please
yes
thanks for waiting
do n't mention it
so I've checked again huh on er you said the RER B
yes
yesterday
yes
unfortunately I have n't found a suit in a grey hanging bag huh I 'm going to see if since yesterday
no the hanging bag is black
the black hanging bag and grey suit my mistake sorry
we do n't give a damn but
I had well noted a black hanging bag and grey suit
yes
do n't worry I have got it right
yes
er Because I have things but er I have a bag with clothes which has been brought back but it 's a Celio bag with men 's clothes huh it 's
and it 's not that
no it was brought back but was lost yesterday at er Robinson at twelve fourty huh
oh no no
so it 's obviously not that one
yes
er I have some things but they would more similar to papers identity cards keys and stuff like that
no
anyway I 'm going to check between today and yesterday huh
hmm hmm
if I have anything
and so
the problem is that I have checked on the network if someone has bought back the hanging bag with the suit at a SNCF desk for instance because at the Gare du Nord you have
yes
the SNCF station so there it can be brought back we do n't keep anything as the SNCF hand over everything to Morillons street at the lost and found items of Paris
when you mention the SNCF do you mean the station
yeah the big station yeah yeah yeah
the station even there we have called and they have n't found anything
they have nothing
no
because no matter where the item is brought back it will go back to Morillons street at the lost and found items of Paris
yes
if it has been found by someone get it
yes
huh I can 't see why someone would keep a jacket once
yes yes yes
it 's a matter of size er
I would advise you to wait a few days and then call the lost and found items of Paris
ok
I 'm going to give you their number

she has lost it lost it on
the way home
outside
outside
yes she lost it outside
ok
she knows she does n't have it anymore
ok
but she does n't really know where she has lost it so could
you tell me what to do
what you have to do is is to go to a sales office
yes I saw for instance hers is a two or three zones so the sales office I saw is at Creteil its in the ninety four so we have to go to the Val de Marne
you are
or we can go to Paris
where are you closest to
to the Place d' Italie it 's the closest yes
the closest
yes
so I 'm going to give you an office er the address of an office which is even closer
yes because we
are otherwise at Villejuif
you can go anywhere

to to Villejuif yes
you can go in any er sales office in fact huh
yes
so a sales office
I 'm going to write it down I 'm going to get a pen

so when you go there er they will make you another card
yes
on the other hand you will be charged twenty three euros for the card
actually
yes

because as it is her who is going to go so if I 'm not there I will give her a check no er not with payable to but it bothers me I would rather er
it 's either by check or credit card
ah ok

asked everyone around me and someone said that er yes a lady had found it and she had got off she said that she was going to bring it back but I do n't know when she was going to bring it back or if she has used it to make a bonfire in fact I do n't know
ok so
what colour was the Monoprix bag
fluorescent pink

bye
bye madam
hello
NNAAMMEE Hello
yes
I 'm listening
hello madam
yes
hello
I 'm calling er I live outside Paris and I heard that we could visit Paris with a special card the Visit Paris card
yes
what is it exactly
yes that 's it madam it 's a pass which is valid for one two or three days
and so the problem for one day
five days
is that it can 't be the same price if it 's for a week if
oh no when
so it 's
for a day for Paris it 's only nine euros madam
nine euros per person
yes
and because I 'm going to Vaires sur Marne and
I
oh yes
but in that case it is no longer in Paris
ah huh really is n't it part of Paris
oh no it 's
so that 's not it then
another district
so that 's not what I want
er no it 's to go from Vaires sur Marne to make a round trip from Paris Vaires
er
to the Vaires Torcy station
you are going to
huh er
I do n't know if there are any buses or how they run huh but I know there is a train but
yes it 's by train
yes
yes
I 'm looking to see the number of zones you will need please hold madam
madam
yes
so Vaires is the fifth zone
so
yes
you will have to buy a Visit Paris card for zones one to six
so a zone
from one to
six
one
to six that 's it
it will cost eighteen euros ninety
per
day
and per person
eighteen euros that 's right
ninety per day and per person for information only the price of a single ticket
hold on
single
I do n't get it ninety and then you tell eighteen I do n't understand
so let me go over it again
no er the price
madam
it 's the price that er
eighteen euros ninety
ah eighteen euros ninety per person
yes madam
ok
for your information the price of a single ticket from Paris to Vaires is four euros ten so that you can count and compare
it 's four euros ten
the single ticket yes
and then the return ticket
will cost the double eight euros twenty
huh
so
it 's less expensive also cause I thought that there were also buses but there are n't any which go to Vincennes
er also to Vaires sur Marne do you know
any
no
any buses
yes
which leave from Vaires and which go to Vincennes
one moment please I 'm
that would be nice
checking please hold on
hello
madam
yes
I 'm looking into the buses which leave from Vaires and I only have the four hundred and twenty one which goes to the Emerainville- Pontault-Combault station but does n't go by Vincennes at all and I have the two hundred and eleven er which does n't go by either Vincennes that 's why I can 't really see which
oh well I thought that there was one at Vincennes no no
which bus are you talking about oh no no no
oh nevermind as I live faraway I thought
oh no no no
ok huh the two hundred and eleven does n't head to Vincennes anyway
no I have told you that the two hundred and eleven goes from the Chelles station to the Torcy station
ah yes ok
going through
lognes
noisiel do you get it
oh yes no no
it 's not what I wanted
yeah yeah yeah
no the four hundred and twenty one
it 's the same thing then
huh four hundred and twenty one goes from the Vaires Torcy station to Emerainville Pontault Combault going through Torcy
croissy Emerainville get it
yes oh no it 's not what I want
yeah
ok
no no
they do n't they do n't go to Paris
so well
ok and the
hmm hmm
visit Paris card what did you say for one day
yes
when it 's for
several days then when it 's for three days for instance it 's the same price
oh no huh no it 's obviously dearer huh
oh ok
three days
oh so for zones one to six it 's forty euros fifty cents
ok
yes
ok so thanks
not at all

NNAAMMEE Hello
yes hello
I 'm calling cause actually I lost my Navigo Pass
yes
so well actually I had lost it well it was stolen and in fact I had lost it and it was brought back
very well
that 's it but in fact it expired on October thirtieth
yes
and so I would like to know how to recharge it cause I do n't know if I have to go to a sales office or if I can do it in the underground cause I saw there were some machines as it a Imagine R so it 's a direct debit each month but I have subscribed for a year and now it has come to an end so I must recharge it and I do n't know how I do n't know how to do it
so for an Imagine R
er
yeah
you must inform them that you are still a student do they know that
yes yes I 'm still a student
they know it cause you have declared losing your card
no I have n't declared it infact
because
so your Imagine R
we do n't know if you have lost it
er no no they do n't know if I have lost it they must well it does n't work anymore so I must subscribe again for a year whatever
indeed so you should have received a letter from Imagine R asking you to recharge your Pass again
for the new year er no
did you get their letter
er no I did n't get it I did n't get anything
and when you go to a ticket machine can you
because in fact yeah
recharge your Pass once more
well I do n't know in fact I have just got it back I do n't know yet but I want to know if I must go to a ticket machine
in the underground then
go to a ticket machine
normally you should have got a letter
ok
telling you that you could recharge your Pass once more
er ok
yeah could you hold on thanks
yes yes
ok otherwise so it was for the information which should be written when you can recharge once more
it 's er
yes
you should go to a ticket office to find out if it is mentioned whether you have a delivery on the way that is to say that your demand has been examined and taken into account and you can recharge your Pass again
ok so I 'm in the so I have n't asked to recharge my my card before er normally it won 't be possible whatever I won 't be able to recharge it straight away is that it
no it can be done
it is done automatically
yes automatically it is done very quickly
as soon as you go to a ticket office they will see that you have a delivery on the way
ok
that is to say
ok
your card is ready to be recharged
and from then on you can recharge it and leave with it
ok
ok and to recharge it you must have the card er
well what do I need in fact
oh yes oh yes yes
oh yeah I need my credit card too
ok ok
not even a credit card
oh no no you need your Navigo card
so I need my Navigo card but I do n't need the credit card which
no not all
the ticket has been taken from
ok it is going to be done automatically
no no not at all not at all
ok ok very well ok because in fact I called them once and they told me I had to go to a sales office
the one in Montparnasse
yes
and they would take my pass er
so maybe they refused you it cause maybe you told them it was lost
then
yeah I had told them it was lost but yeah ok so yeah
that 's why they told you that
oh yes so if it was lost
declared lost you must indeed make another one huh that 's for sure
no no no but it has n't been declared lost so it 's ok
so it 's another story
ok well thanks a lot
do n't mention it madam
miss see you
have a nice day bye
bye
bye
NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello sir
er I 'm leaving er this afternoon from Sebastopol and I must go to er Stains at ninety eight Jean Jaures Street
sebastopol er Sebastopol boulevard in which area
in the second
the second ok and at which number
er the ninety eight so I 'm leaving from eighty nine sorry and I must go to ninety eight jean Jaures street
in Stains
in Stains that 's it
jean Jaures in Stains at No ninety eight huh
that 's right
it 's
it sir yeah
ok could you please hold
thanks
please
yes
at what time should you be there cause it 's a little bit complicated the
trip
yeah it 's a bit complicated
I must be there at five pm well four pm er four forty five pm whatever
well it 's not that it is complicated but it 's true that it is not
obvious
yeah so in this case we are going to
cause there was the RER D
yeah yeah er there was
but well at the moment er
well er the D it 's ok it 's ok huh
it is working the D
er
yes yes of course and you should take er get off at Pierrefitte Stains
yeah
and after er on foot it is quite a walk
hum hum
huh you should take er what you can do is er is after catch the two er the two hundred and fifty five which passes next to the station which goes along Jean Jaures street
yeah
so there is a two or three minute walk huh you should look at the map of the area er to catch the two hundred and fifty five
ok
heading to Les Prevoyants to the last stop
hum ok does the two hundred and fifty five pass through the Saint Denis university underground
yes but it 's going to very long er it will be a long trip for you huh
it will be long
er I hid it earlier but not going through Saint Denis er in that case you should take it er er you can are you at Reaumur
at
yes
reaumur Sebastopol you take the line four heading to Porte de Clignancourt to Porte de Clignancourt
hum hum
and there you have the first stop for the two hundred and fifty five
ok well
heading to Les Prevoyants to Les Prevoyants but it will take you an hour and a quarter huh
huh oh yeah no an hour er un hour and a quarter it 's far too long
well yes that 's the problem huh
oh yeah yeah yeah it 's far too long so if you
but otherwise it 's true that it passes at Porte de Paris on the line thirteen and with the change er between line four and the line thirteen er is it worth it and after catch er Porte de Paris er yeah why not get off at Porte de Paris and there you can catch the two hundred and fifty five I do n't know if you will gain much time huh huh
so you are telling me that it will take me an hour and a quarter to get there
yes it will take you er with the line four and the two hundred and fifty five well it 's the two hundred and fifty five huh it 's the first stop huh so there are quite a few stops huh
yeah yeah er what I meant was er so the easiest well the most convenient whatever is to take the RER or the underground at Saint Denis university
huh if you are in a real hurry
well I 'm not in a hurry but I would like it to be as short as possible whatever
oh yeah yeah well in this case it 's the RER huh
the RER
oh yes
to
to Pierrefitte Stains and after er a little walk to catch the two hundred and fifty five
yeah
and after you 'll be at Les Prevoyants
pierrefitte Stains ok
get off
it will take you er
roughly forty five minutes
ah well forty five minutes like that I will gain half an hour
oh yes that 's why
oh well great
rER D to Pierrefitte Stains the two hundred and fifty five Les Prevoyants and I get off at Les Prevoyants
that 's it
and it is in the Jean Jaures street
yes that 's it the two hundred and fifty five you will catch it er in Jean Jaures street
ok
huh you have a bus the hundred and fifty which can take you there but there is about a five minute walk is it worth waiting for the hundred and fifty to catch it to have two stops to catch the hundred and fifty
the two hundred and fifty five
no no no
I 'm going to walk if it is only five minutes it 's ok huh
oh yes yes it 's not far
ok ok well thanks a lot Sir
at your service
thanks bye
have a good day bye
NNAAMMEE will take your call
NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello sorry to disturb you
well let me explain today I had a fine er at Goncourt and I was given the paper and as I was looking for my Imagine R card I lost the fine
and I would like
yes
to know what is the number to reach
them in fact
but you would like to reach er
what service
well let me explain
normally I have an Imagine R card
yes
and well I lost I lost it that day
hum ok
and in fact I would like to reach er the people who deal with the fines to tell them to cancel it because I already pay for a subscription
and the problem is that the number is on the fine
well I do n't have it I have lost the fine so I do n't have the number
ok but it can 't be done by phone huh if you want to benefit from a clemency measure
you
you
should go to the fine service I am going to give you their address huh where you will have to go
one moment please
ok do I have to
write a letter
pardon me
do I have to write a letter or do I just go there
no
you must go there because they must see that you have a Pass which
belongs to you
but in fact I do n't have it
I lost it and I'll be getting it only in eight days time
oh well in that case you must absolutely go to a sales office straight away with your identity card to declare the loss of your Pass
and there you will be
I have already
made another
pass
sorry for interrupting you
but I have already called in fact all is ok for the Imagine R card I called them and told them that I had lost my Pass and they are going to send me it in eight days time
but the problem is that as the man gave me and in fact he wanted to give me a fifty euro fine but I did n't have fifty euros on me he raised it to seventy two
and the problem is that it will probably be raised again
hum
oh but then
in that case you are going to write
I can write it
huh you will explain what the situation is
regarding your
ok
fine that you are waiting for your new Imagine R Pass and then you 'll see what they will reply regarding your fine huh you will have to write so in that case do you have a pen to write it down
yes
yes
I will give you
the address huh
so it is
thanks
so Litigation fine centre
so litigation centre
ok
for fines
yes
it 's twenty one
twenty for you it 's even er hang on for you the postal code will be thirteen Jules Valles street
yes
er Valles it 's V A
v A double L
yes
e S
ok thanks
hum and it is seventy five zero eleven Paris
ok
thanks
huh so er
write them a letter explaining what happened and do n't forget to put the date and the day and that you are waiting for your card
ok on the other hand I have another question which has nothing to do with that when we are arrested er how many fines can we get
well all depends what the ticket inspector told you
it depends on
well
the circumstances and the place you are at
the fine
ok
can change huh if you are controlled at the machines in a corridor er the fine is not the same
you you were
ok
controlled when you entered the control line
well yes
in fact er
hum
in fact I could n't be bothered at first to take my Imagine R card
hum hum
so I passed with a friend
and when I looked for it in my bag I could n't find it
so I said
hum
well listen sir give me a fine and then I will ask for a refund and so he said it was fifty euros
yes of course cause you passed with your friend
behind
hum
a controling machine
ok
yes
ok
ok ok
well thanks
do n't mention it
thanks a lot bye
at your service have a good day Miss

bye madam
NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello madam
er
hello
I am NNAAMMEE NNAAMMEE I work in a town hall in the Loire Atlantique region
yes
er hum we have a group of children in the townhall who are going er on the fourteenth of December to Paris to visit the National assembly
yes
so er they are going by train and they will have to take the underground after to go to the National Assembly
ok
and so I was on the RATP site and I wanted to know er if we could buy the tickets already and if there was also a special fare for groups
so
so what station are you going to arrive at
montparnasse
montparnasse so it 's a group of pupils is that it
yeah there are ten er sorry twelve sixteen children and two adults
so there are sixteen children and two adults
yes
so they are only going to do one trip in the day and then go back
well I do n't know exactly when they arrive in the morning and leave in the evening so they visit the National Assembly in the afternoon yes they may move around later
it 's in Paris
indeed
yeah move around in Paris
so on the other hand on our site you should have seen that there were groups for youngsters
yes
huh but that is for ten pupils and an accompanying adult
hum hum
so you are sixteen and two
hum hum
so normally it 's ten for one so we will have to see otherwise it allows you to have a reduced price
for everyone
yes
in fact er the children and the adults
that 's right
ok
that 's it so on the other hand as you are sixteen plus two I must check huh to see what happens so it allows you to have the reduced price ticket which means you are allowed to have the reduced price tickets
ok
knowing that the reduced price tickets will cost you five euros seventy
and you will have ten tickets
five euros eighty
so five euros eighty the reduced price tickets
and it will be for ten tickets
so er it is n't possible to order them in advance cause you need to buy tickets for a value of at least hundred and fifty euros
oh yes ok
ok so what other tickets are there how old are the children
er they are between the ages of ten and twelve
ok cause otherwise after there are day trip tickets er so they are coming during the week then
yes
it would be
five euros ninety per child per person
hum ok
otherwise it is called
the Mobilis and there you have a ticket which is valid all day long and so they can take the underground and after if they want to visit Paris it 's five euros ninety
ok
now for the group of youngsters I 'm going to look it up huh please hold on a minute
thanks
yes
please
yes
so indeed huh you are allowed to have the youngsters group ticket there 's no problem about that so you will all benefit from reduced prices if you go on our RATP site
yes
did you see the youngsters group huh
but I saw that there was a reduced price for youngsters ok but there is a form
so
there to fill out
to print in two copies the two copies you have to fill out huh
ok
cause there is one copy that you keep and the other which you give to the agent at the station
ok
ok so well after you indicate how many tickets you need
and the trip
ok
ok so after you have to do some calculating huh either you do that if you have only one or two trips or if you are really going to visit Paris after what can be interesting is the five euros ninety ticket
yes
like that you do n't need to worry all day long
ok yes yes
ok
and so on the other hand you can 't order them before so you will have to buy them once you 're there whatever
actually
yes that 's it
when we get to Montparnasse
ok
ok
ok
well thanks
have a very good day
bye
thanks bye
